Import `SRS 2017 FOR SAS.ods` since this has daily averages of weather data instead of every 30 minutes in `SRS 2017 FOR R.ods`.

```{r}
necrosis17 <- read_ods("data/raw/SRS 2017 FOR SAS.ods") %>% 
	
	gather(key = "Root", value = "necrosis_level", `Root 1`:`Root 30`) %>% 
	
	group_by(Facility, Grower, Stack, Harvest, Cut) %>% 
	
	summarise(incidence = sum(necrosis_level > 1, na.rm = TRUE) / n())
	
weather17 <- read_ods("data/raw/SRS 2017 FOR SAS.ods", sheet = 2) %>% 
	
	na.omit() %>% 
	
	mutate(Date = lubridate::mdy(Date))
